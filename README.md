## Scope and Brief Description of the System

The Cupsule Hotel Management System, is a database application designed to help administration to manage hotel(room reservations, room cleaning, security) 

- Client registration
- Possibility for a client to book a room
- Storage of client data (passport, PESEL(optional), phone, email)
- A system to change the room number if a client wants to switch rooms
- A system that has client priority understanding (system has a list of clients where they sorted based on the time client had made a reservation, and if they don't confirm/pay for the reservation they are removed from this list and we move to the next client on th list and repeat)

## System Requirements and Technical stack
- Database Management System: Microsoft SQL Server
- Database Design Tool: SQL Server Management Studio 
- Query Language: Transact-SQL
- Data Storage Type: Relational database
- Core Components Used: 
  - Tables Primary & Foreign Keys
  - Views 
  - Stored Procedures 
  - Indexes 
  - Constraints 

### Functional Requirements List:

- Adding new records to the database: The system must allow users to add new data to the tables (e.g., new clients, products).
- Chec room anailability: The sistem automatically checks for available rooms on selected dates.
- Editing data: The system should allow editing of existing data, such as changing a client's address and so on
- Searching for dat**a: Users should be able to search for data based on various criteria (e.g., name, phone number, registration date).
- **Reporting: The system must be able to generate reports based on collected data (e.g., a list of all orders in a given period).
- User permission management: The system should allow different users to perform different actions based on assigned roles (e.g., administrator, employee).
- Notifications and warnings: Displey warnings if, for example, the client already has a booking or dates overlap.

### Technical Stack:

- Database: MySQL
- Query Language: SQL
- Database Design tools: MySQL Workbench, dbdiagram.io
- System of version control: Git, GitHub
